# exploring-houston-restaurant-weeks

## Motivation
If you are a foodie in Houston, TX, then you look forward to this time of the year for the Houston Restaurant Weeks (HRW). A number of local restaurants come together to offer special menus and donate a part of each customer served to the Houston Food Bank. While this is a wonderful initiative, the information displayed on their website makes it difficult to search through. The overarching goal of this project is to aid HRW enthusiasts while they decide on which restaurants they want to visit this year.
